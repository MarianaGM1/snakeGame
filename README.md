# snakeGame
Classic snake game I did as part of a project for Scrimba's Frontend Dev Career Path. It was done with Vanilla JavaScript.

In the course, the focus of the project was the functionality of the game, not the style of it. 

So, what I did was: 

    - Style it.
    - Add sounds effects.
    - Add a 'Previous score'.
    - Add a modal that shows up when you lose. 
    - I separated the 'start' and the 'restart' functionalities.
    - Updated the keyCode to e.key
